  This is an example for the Adafruit NEC Remote Control

  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit NEC Remote Control
	----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/389
  and IR Receiver Sensor
	----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/157

  These devices use IR to communicate, 1 pin is required to  
  interface
